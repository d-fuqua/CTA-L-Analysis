## Summary of Insights
### Riders per Line:
- Before the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership peaked on October 2018 for all lines except for the yellow line, which peaked two months prior. After the start of the pandemic, ridership plummetted to its all time low in April 2020 for all lines. Ridership has began to rebound, with ridership reaching their highest highs since the pandemic in September and October of 2022.
- Despite ridership increasing from the start of the pandemic, the current ridership peaks of September and October 2022 are only roughly half of the peaks in 2018.
- The red line and the blue line lead the way in ridership total, with the red line having the most riders at all months in the sample. Additionally, there does not apppear to be any particular line that has seen additional growth or loss since the pandemic. All of the lines lost and regained the same proportion of riders since the pandemic.

### Riders vs. Loop Stops:
- Ridership on stops in the Loop was stable before the pandemic, peaking in October of 2018. After the pandemic, it reached its lowest ridership in April 2020, but has steadily grown in ridership in each year. Despite this growth, its post-pandemic peak in October 2022 is only half of what it was in October 2018.
- Ridership on stops outside of the loop makes up a much more sizable chunk of all of train ridership. The non-loop ridership follows the same pattern as the ridership split per line. Non-loop ridership is roughly 7 times larger than loop ridership and has the same peaks and valleys as loop ridership.

### Riders per Day Type:
- Ridership per day type follows a very similar shape as the loop vs. non-loop ridership graph. The vast majority of the ridership takes place during the weekdays, while ridership on Saturdays and Sundays & holidays is consistent throughout the year. The total riders has the same peaks and valleys as the previous two figures.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- The red line and the blue line contain roughly half of all ridership. To keep an increase in total ridership, explore ways to get more riders onto these lines.
- The ridership on non-loop stops is much more volatile than loop stops. Investigate ways to get more consistent ridership on stops outside of the loop.
